Let’s look at some observations about the data we are storing:

The service needs to store 100 -1000 records .

The service is somewhat heavy.

Each object is small like (<10).

There are no relationships between each record, except for storing which user created the short link.

Schema:

We’ll now consider database schemas. We need a table for storing information.
The best choice would be to use a NoSQL database store like DynamoDB or Cassandra since we are storing billions of rows with no relationships between the objects.


1)Average Response Time is the overall response time for a round-trip request, including the load time for HTML, XML, CSS, JavaScript files and images, among others.
It may also include maximum response time showing how long a user waits for the server to respond to a request.

2) Response Time Test has two most essential characteristic:

Average response time.
Maximum response time.
It shows how long a user needs to wait for the server to the response its request.

3)error can be calucluted by Rate limits. rate limits are calculated in Requests Per Second, or RPS. For example, let's say a developer only wants to allow a client to call the API a maximum of 10 times per minute.
In this case the developer would apply a rate limit to their API expressed as “10 requests per 60 seconds”.
